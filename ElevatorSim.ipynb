    "# Attempting to Model Elevator Situation with SimPy\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "My apartment building has three elevators, but one is reserved for freight. So, it really has two elevators which are called with one button. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the elevators broke down, so the building opened the freight elevator up to the residents. The freight elevator has its own button on each floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed one day as I was descending that my elevator kept stopping and no one would get in. The people in my building had started pressing both buttons and then getting in the elevator that arrived first.\n",
    "\n",
    "That got me thinking about math. Here are my research questions:\n",
    "1. Are we all worse off if everyone does this behavior?\n",
    "2. Is there a threshold for how many people have to do this to make it worse?\n",
    "3. Can we solve this problem through simulation and probability (numerical and analytical)?\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know much about queuing theory or probability, so this is going to be challenging for me. I will start with the numerical approach"
